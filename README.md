# STATISTICA

## A Small WIP C++ Library for statistical calculations 

**Created mostly for personal use - and as a way to fight boredom/force myself to work with C++ more.**

**Yes, the code is not the best at the moment. it's a subject for change in the near future**


**MORE FUNCTIONALITIES COMING SOON** 

## CHANGELOG

### VER 0.01 (LATEST)

- Some basic functions that work with standard C style arrays. 
- At the moment, **All functions definitons are in the same header file as the headers themselves.** **I know it's bad, it will be changed soon.**
